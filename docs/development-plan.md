# Development Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the development of a large-scale, microservices-based grocery e-commerce platform supporting 100,000 daily active users (DAU), 300,000 peak users, and 50,000 SKUs. The platform prioritizes scalability, performance (≤500ms search, ≤2s page load, ≤100ms inventory updates, 99.9% uptime), and grocery-specific features (e.g., real-time inventory, same-day delivery, substitutions, multilingual English/Vietnamese UX). It runs on Kubernetes/Docker on-premises, with future cloud migration (e.g., AWS EKS). As a solo developer, the plan focuses on automation, prioritization, and modularity to streamline implementation.

## Scope
- **MVP Features**:
  - Product Catalog: Browse/search 50,000 SKUs, multilingual descriptions.
  - Inventory: Real-time stock updates (≤100ms), perishable tracking, substitutions.
  - Order: Cart, checkout (≤1s), order tracking.
  - Payment: Stripe integration, PCI DSS compliant.
  - User: JWT-based authentication, basic profiles.
  - Delivery: Grab/ViettelPost integration, same-day slots (≤500ms), in-store pickup.
  - Notifications: Basic order/delivery updates (email/SMS).
- **Post-MVP Features** (Deferred):
  - Promotions: Discounts, perishable-specific deals.
  - Search: Advanced filtering (e.g., Elasticsearch).
  - Recommendation: Personalized suggestions.
  - Additional integrations (e.g., MoMo, Gojek).
- **Non-Functional**:
  - Scalability: Handle 300,000 peak users.
  - Performance: ≤500ms search, ≤2s page load, ≤100ms inventory updates.
  - Uptime: ≥99.9%.
  - Security: JWT, RBAC, TLS 1.3, PCI DSS compliance.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Django) for transactional services, Node.js (NestJS) for real-time services.
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (transactional), Firestore (real-time).
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes/Docker, NGINX Ingress, Redis (caching), Cloudflare (CDN).
- **Messaging**: Kafka for async events.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with self-hosted runners.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana, Loki, OpenTelemetry/Jaeger.
- **Testing**: pytest, Jest, Cypress, Locust, Testcontainers.
- **Third-Party**: Stripe (payments), Grab/ViettelPost (delivery).

## Development Phases
The plan is divided into phases, with estimated durations assuming 20–30 hours/week of solo development. Timelines are approximate and can be adjusted based on progress.

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure (2–3 Weeks)

**Code Snippet (Inventory Service)**:
```typescript
// services/inventory/src/stock.controller.ts
import { Controller, Get, Param } from '@nestjs/common';
import { StockService } from './stock.service';

@Controller('stock')
export class StockController {
  constructor(private readonly stockService: StockService) {}

  @Get(':sku')
  async getStock(@Param('sku') sku: string) {
    return this.stockService.getStock(sku); // ≤100ms, Firestore read
  }
}
```
**Output**: Functional MVP services with REST APIs, Kafka integration, and basic grocery features.

## Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 26–35 weeks (6–8 months) for MVP (Phases 1–6), plus 6–8 weeks for post-MVP (Phase 7).
- **Breakdown**:
  - Phase 1: 2–3 weeks
  - Phase 2: 8–10 weeks
  - Phase 3: 3–4 weeks
  - Phase 4: 2–3 weeks
  - Phase 5: 3–4 weeks
  - Phase 6: 2–3 weeks
  - Phase 7: 6–8 weeks (optional)
- **Assumption**: 20–30 hours/week, with flexibility for adjustments (e.g., faster progress with automation).

## Best Practices for Solo Development
- **Prioritization**: Focus on MVP (Product Catalog, Inventory, Order, Payment, User, Delivery, Notification) to launch quickly. Defer Promotions, Search, Recommendation.
- **Automation**:
  - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD (lint, test, deploy).
  - Deploy monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana, Loki) early to catch issues.
  - Script repetitive tasks (e.g., Firestore seeding) in `/scripts`.
- **Task Management**: Use GitHub Projects with Kanban board (To-Do, In Progress, Done). Label tasks (e.g., `priority:high`, `grocery`) and set milestones (e.g., “MVP”).
- **Technical Debt**:
  - Allocate 10% of time to refactoring (e.g., optimize Inventory queries).
  - Use Snyk to catch vulnerabilities early.
- **Grocery-Specific**:
  - Test inventory locking and substitution flows rigorously to prevent oversells.
  - Ensure delivery slot APIs are cached (Redis) for ≤500ms responses.
  - Validate multilingual UX (English/Vietnamese) in beta.
- **Cloud Prep**: Use cloud-agnostic tools (e.g., MinIO, Helm) and test staging deployments for AWS/GCP compatibility.

## Monitoring and Validation
- **KPIs**: Track during beta and production (Phase 6):
  - Conversion Rate: ≥3%.
  - Order Fulfillment: ≥95%.
  - Inventory Accuracy: ≥99%.
  - Slot Booking Success: ≥98%.
  - Uptime: ≥99.9%.
- **Tools**: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics, GA4 for user behavior, Hotjar for UX, Firestore for grocery events.
- **Feedback**: Collect beta feedback via Google Forms/Hotjar to refine UX (e.g., checkout, slots).

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Overrunning timeline | Delays launch | Prioritize MVP, automate tests, use GitHub Projects for tracking. |
| Performance issues | Slow UX (e.g., >1s checkout) | Cache with Redis, test with Locust, monitor with Prometheus. |
| Third-party failures | Payment/delivery disruptions | Use circuit breakers, mock APIs in tests, cache responses. |
| Technical debt | Maintenance burden | Refactor incrementally, enforce coverage ≥80%, use Snyk. |

## Next Steps
- Start Phase 1 (setup) by initializing the repo and Kubernetes cluster.
- Review tasks in GitHub Projects weekly, adjusting priorities as needed.
- Deploy monitoring early (Phase 1) to track progress and catch issues.
- Revisit plan post-MVP to prioritize post-MVP features (e.g., Promotions, MoMo).
